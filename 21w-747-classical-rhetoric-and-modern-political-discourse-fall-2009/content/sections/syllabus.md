Course Requirements
-------------------

### Class Format

The course work is primarily "front-loaded." One of the major projects is collaborative and you will develop the final large paper in a series of steps. These are further meant to help you enjoy and accomplish the course assignments. Most importantly, you should have fun in this course!

### Readings

This semester, there will be two sets of rhetorical texts and speeches that will serve as the primary readings for the class. The first will consist of various articles taking specific positions on the current debate on health care reform. The second set of readings of will consist of three speeches by Abraham Lincoln.

### Assignments

There are several guidelines for using sources in your academic writing:

*   Cite information that is not considered common knowledge, a direct quotation, or a summary of another's words/ideas.
*   When you quote, quote exactly, use quotation marks, and cite the source.
*   When you summarize, you keep the meaning of the source but put it in your own words and cite the original source.

In sum, your essays should always be your own work. Your essays should always be your _new_ work created specifically for this course.

### Attendance

This course requires your attendance, participation, and on-time submission of assignments:

*   There are **3 penalty-free absence**; save these for illness, religious reasons, job interviews, etc.
*   The **4th** absence lowers your final course grade by half a letter grade; the 5th absence lowers it by an entire letter grade.
*   The **6th** absence means **automatic failure for the course**; you should drop the course immediately to avoid its showing up on your transcript.
*   Please be on time for class. Chronic lateness or early departure will count as a cut.
*   If you have not completed the assignment for the day, you may be counted absent.
*   The class on Ses #22 is optional, and will consist of screening and discussion of important political speeches.
